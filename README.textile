A Django database field for storing "YAML":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML data

This version uses yaml.load_safe() instead of yaml.load(), enabling you to use it with untrusted data, but disabling some features like storing python objects.

h3. Getting started

Install this module

<pre><code>$ pip install django-yamlfield</code></pre>

Add it to one of your models.

<pre><code>from django.db import models
from yamlfield import YAMLField

class YourModel(models.Model):
    yaml = YAMLField()</code></pre>

That's it! You can now start storing YAML data.

h3. Credits

This module was developed by Ben Welsh, based on Brad Jasper's "django-jsonfield":https://github.com/bradjasper/django-jsonfield.

h3. The rest

* Supports Django version 1.2 and up and Python versions 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, which is routinely tested using "Travis CI":http://travis-ci.org/#!/datadesk/django-yamlfield
